# FinTech SecureCorp: Enterprise Network Design & Security Validation

## Project Overview
This project presents the design and implementation of a secure network infrastructure for **"FinTech SecureCorp,"** a simulated financial technology environment. The project focuses on high-availability, logical segmentation, and robust security access controls to protect sensitive financial data in a FinTech ecosystem.

## My Roles & Responsibilities
In this collaborative graduate project, I served as the **Technical Lead for Documentation and Network Validation**, ensuring the project met professional standards and technical accuracy.

### 1. Technical Documentation & Refinement
- **Report Excellence:** Refined and restructured the overall project report (Chapter 1 to 5) to ensure professional academic standards and high-quality technical narrative.
- **Data Structuring:** Developed comprehensive IP addressing schemes and implementation tables (Chapter 4) to ensure scalable network routing.

### 2. Network Design & Logical Validation
- **Logical Topology & Segmentation:** Designed and validated the logical network structure and security segmentation using **Cisco Packet Tracer**.
- **Access Control Implementation:** Configured and tested **Standard & Extended ACLs** to secure internal segments and protect the Server Farm area.
- **NAT Configuration:** Implemented Network Address Translation (NAT) to facilitate secure public-facing services (Web Server).
- **Routing Strategy:** Verified the stability of **Static Routing** as the primary backbone for this specific architectural requirement.

### 3. Simulation & Security Verification
- **Technical Validation:** Managed the transition from GNS3 to **Cisco Packet Tracer** to ensure functional delivery while maintaining core security features like filtering and access control.
- **Evidence of Work:** Produced technical video recordings to demonstrate the network's resilience and functional integrity.

## Key Deliverables
- **Technical Report (PDF):** In-depth documentation of the planning and implementation phases.
- **Simulation Files (.pkt):** Validated Cisco Packet Tracer files with complete CLI configurations.
- **Visual Assets:** Topology diagrams and IP addressing tables for quick reference.

## Technologies Used
- **Network Simulation:** Cisco Packet Tracer
- **Security Protocols:** Access Control Lists (ACL), NAT, AES Cryptography
- **System Analysis:** Advanced Documentation & Requirement Validation
